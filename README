================================================================
	ASeqView - ALSA sequencer event viewer / filter
		ver.0.2.0

================================================================

INTRODUCTION
============

ASeqView is an ALSA sequencer user-client which works as event viewr.
It visualizes received events, e.g. note-on/off, controls, pitch
wheels, using bar graphs, as often seen in many sequencer programs.
Using this viewer, even a simple command line sequencer like pmidi or
playmidi1 becomes a cool one with graphical interface :-)

Another feature of ASeqView is redirection of events.
ASeqView can output the received events to subscription ports with
some modification like channel mute or pitch change.  Since this works 
as a real-time filter client, such modifications can be applied also
in real-time without complexity.


REQUIREMENTS
============

- ALSA 	0.5.0 or newer (sequencer protocol version >= 1.0.0)
	0.4.x doesn't work
- Gtk+	1.2 or newer


CONNECTING TO THE MIDI PORT
===========================

1. CONNECTION VIA ACONNECT

   Just run ASeqView

	% aseqview

   Then, connect this client to your MIDI port (e.g. 65:0)

	% aconnect 128:0 65:0
   If you miss aconnect utility, compile it under alsa-lib/test
   directory via "make aconnect", and install it to the suitable
   path.

2. DIRECT CONNECTION FROM ASEQVIEW

   Use -d option to the output MIDI port:

	% aseqview -d 65:0

   Run sequencer (e.g. pmidi) and connect to ASeqView:

	% pmidi -p128:0 foo.mid


BUTTONS
=======

The slider bars on the bottom are pitch and velocity scale adjustment.
You can change the current pitch +/-12 tones and velociy scale from 0
to 200% in real time.  The channel buttons from 0 to 15 is used to
mute or unmute the channel.

If you need lower latency, become root and run with -r option
(or chown setuid root to this program).  This changes the schedule
to FIFO with maximam prority.  You'll get in most cases sub-msec
latency.


COMMANDLINE OPTIONS
===================

   -o	Suppress output to the subscription port.
	ASeqView works only as an event viewer.

   -r	Set real-time priority (see above).
	This option is enalbed only for root.

   -p ports
	Set number of ports to be opened.  As default 1.
	Each port opens a window to visualize the received events
	to it.  Only the port 0 has control buttons like pitch
	change, etc.

   -s client:port
	Set input connection port.  The specified port is subscribed
	for input when the program starts.

   -d client:port
	Set output connection port.
	As default, ASeqView sends events to the subscription port,
	which is redirected to the attached ports by connection manager
	like aconnect utility.  If this option is given, the events
	are sent only to the specified port.

   -t
	Run with multi-threading.  This mode is used as default.

   -m
	Run without multi-threading.

   -P
	Don't show piano bars.

TODO
====

- Display keyboard
- Better Gtk programming
- Better visualization
