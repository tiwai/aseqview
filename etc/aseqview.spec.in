================================================================
	ASeqView - ALSA sequencer event viewer / filter
		ver.0.1.2

================================================================

ASeqView is an ALSA sequencer user-client which works as event viewr.
It visualizes received events, e.g. note-on/off, controls, pitch
wheels, using bar graphs, as often seen in many sequencer programs.
Using this viewer, even a simple command line sequencer like pmidi or
playmidi1 becomes a cool one with graphical interface :-)

Another feature of ASeqView is redirection of events.
ASeqView can output the received events to subscription ports with
some modification like channel mute or pitch change.  Since this works 
as a real-time filter client, such modifications can be applied also
in real-time without complexity.
